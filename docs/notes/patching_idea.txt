Adding/changing existing code without a finished decomp is tricky because the replacement code
must be less or equal to the size of the original code, since you can't just shift existing
code up to make room.

Instead, changing a function could choose one of two routes:
1. if the replacement function fits in the original space, just overwrite the binary
2. if it doesn't, link it in at the end of the file, and then patch the original function
  to just jump to our new function

New functions would just always take option 2. Notably, replacing functions cannot change
the function prototype. To change something like the prototype, you would instead need to
make a new function and then patch functions that call it, which for an unfinished decomp
is probably dangerous.
