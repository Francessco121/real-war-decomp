0x4e31c4:	mov	eax, dword ptr [esp + 4]
0x4e31c8:	add	dword ptr [eax], 4
0x4e31cb:	mov	eax, dword ptr [eax]
0x4e31cd:	mov	eax, dword ptr [eax - 4]
0x4e31d0:	ret	

Initial IR:
- each assembly instruction gets a single statement
v1 = arg0
*v1 = *v1 + 4
v2 = *v1
v3 = *(v2 - 4)
return v3

Variable reduction:
- variables that don't get reused later are folded
*arg0 = *arg0 + 4
return *(*arg0 - 4)

Pattern simplification:
- recognize and simplify known patterns 
- (e.g. incrementing something and then returning the decrement is a post-increment)
return (*arg0)++;
