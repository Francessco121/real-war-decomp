- apparently ffmpeg 4.4 can read the .vag audio files
    - ffmpeg -i intro.mpg -i intro.vag intro.mp4
- seems to be compiled with /ML (single-threaded libc, which is the default)
- CD retail release claims the game version is "Real War: V9.25" however the patches
  use the verisons "V1.5" and "V1.6". Version 9.25 was probably an internal version
  and the actual "release version" was more like "V1.0".
- calling conventions:
    - LIBC: __cdecl
    - Win32 APIs: __stdcall
    - RealWar: mainly __cdecl and __stdcall for callbacks given to Win32 APIs
- alignment
    - .text: 16 bytes
    - .data: 4 bytes
    - there may be exceptions but this covers just about everything
